    <p>The youth is one of the focuses of the barangay. To ensure the youthâ€™s welfare, the barangay and its officials make sure that there are no minors in computer shops after 7:00 pm. Students are not allowed to be in computer shops during school hours. In order to implement this, the barangay tanods patrol the area.</p>
