			<td><p>Similar to most of the barangays in Baguio city, Barangay Gibraltar also implements waste segregation. The barangay requires each household or business establishment to segregate their waste into two different categoires, the biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. This practice maintains the cleanliness and freshness of the barangay's environment. It allows them to conveniently sort the waste that could still be recycled.</p> 
            
            <p>The barangay makes sure that they are consistent with the waste management by having the garbage collection every Tuesday 6:00am to 9:00am. Any household or business establishment that fails to follow this will be issued a subpoena.</p></td>
